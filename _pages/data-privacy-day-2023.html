                            <p>Data Privacy Week commemorates the January 28, 1981 signing of Convention 108, the first legally binding international treaty dealing with privacy and data protection. Since 2009, resolutions passed by Congress have supported the designation of January 28th as National Data Privacy Day in the United States. This year, the Data Privacy Day campaign has been expanded into Data Privacy Week, a full week-long initiative.</p>
                            <p>Data Privacy Week is a global effort meant to raise awareness about the importance of respecting privacy, safeguarding data, and enabling trust.

                            <p>The themes for Data Privacy Week 2023 are <strong>"Respect Privacy"</strong> for organizations and <strong>"Data: The Story of You"</strong> for individuals.</p>

                                <li><strong>Know the Tradeoff Between Privacy and Convenience.</strong> Make informed decisions about sharing your personal information with business or services.  Asking yourself these questions can help: “Can you control your data while still using the service?”, “Is the data requested even relevant for the application or service?”, and “Is the service, application, or game worth the amount of personal information they want in return?”.</li>
                                <li><strong>Adjust the Settings to Your Comfort Level.</strong> Take control of your digital identity by checking your privacy and security settings: <a href="https://staysafeonline.org/resources/manage-your-privacy-settings/">staysafeonline.org/resources/manage-your-privacy-settings</a>. You don't have to do this for every account at once, start small and over time you'll make a habit of adjusting all your settings to your comfort.</li>
                                <li><strong>Protect Your Data.</strong> Data privacy and data security go hand-in-hand. Along with managing your privacy settings, follow some simple cybersecurity tips to keep it safe.
