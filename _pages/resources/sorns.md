<h2 class="font-sans-lg text-primary-darker">About</h2>
<p class="font-sans-sm">This page is a compilation of government-wide system of records notices (SORNs), listed by the agency with government-wide responsibility for the system of records.</p>
<p class="font-sans-sm">A government-wide system of records is a system of records where one agency has regulatory authority over records in the custody of multiple agencies, and the agency with regulatory authority publishes a SORN that applies to all of the records regardless of their custodial location. The application of a government-wide SORN ensures that privacy practices with respect to the records are carried out uniformly across the Federal Government in accordance with the rules of the responsible agency. For a government-wide system of records, all agencies – not just the agency with government-wide responsibilities – are responsible for complying with the terms of the SORN and the applicable requirements in the Privacy Act, including the access and amendment provisions that apply to records under an agency’s control.</p>
