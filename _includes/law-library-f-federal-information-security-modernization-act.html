        The Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA) was codified in the E-Government Act of 2002 as the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (44 U.S.C. § 3501 note), and was reauthorized in 2014 (Pub. L. 113-283).

 

The statute pertains to information security, which is defined as “the protection of information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction in order to provide: a) integrity, which means guarding against improper information modification or destruction, and includes ensuring information non-repudiation and authenticity; b) confidentiality, which means preserving authorized restrictions on access and disclosure, including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information; and c) availability, which means ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information.”
