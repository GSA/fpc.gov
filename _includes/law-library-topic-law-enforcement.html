        <P>In response to concerns that emerging technologies such as digital and
          wireless communications were making it increasingly difficult for law
          enforcement agencies to execute authorized surveillance, Congress enacted CALEA
          on October 25, 1994. CALEA requires a “telecommunications carrier,” as defined
          by the CALEA statute, to ensure that equipment, facilities, or services that
          allow a customer or subscriber to “originate, terminate, or direct
          communications,” enable law enforcement officials to conduct electronic
          surveillance pursuant to court order or other lawful authorization. CALEA is
          intended to preserve the ability of law enforcement agencies to conduct
          electronic surveillance by requiring that telecommunications carriers and
          manufacturers of telecommunications equipment design and modify their equipment,
          facilities, and services to ensure that they have the necessary surveillance
          capabilities as communications network technologies evolve. CALEA&nbsp;is
          limited to Telecommunications Carriers as defined by the Act and interpreted by
          the FCC. &nbsp;In addition, CALEA specifically exempts “Information Services”,
          which includes many Internet based communications service providers, electronic
          storage providers and electronic messaging services.</P>

        <P>The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) of 1986 created additional
          privacy protections for stored electronic communications and updated the Federal
          Wiretap Act to cover electronic communications as well as oral and wire
          communications.&nbsp; Title II of the ECPA established a comprehensive system of
          protections for stored communications codified at <A
            href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title18/pdf/USCODE-2011-title18-partI-chap121-sec2701.pdf">18
            U.S.C. §§ 2701-2712 </A>which has come to be referred to as the Stored
          Communications Act (SCA).</P>
        <P>The ECPA, as amended, protects wire, oral, and electronic communications
          while those communications are being made, are in transit, and when they are
          stored on computers. The Act applies to email, telephone conversations, and data
          stored electronically.</P>

          <P>ECPA has three titles:</P>
          <P>Title I of the ECPA, which is often referred to as the Wiretap Act, prohibits
            the intentional actual or attempted interception, use, disclosure, or
            ‘procure[ment] [of] any other person to intercept or endeavor to intercept any
            wire, oral, or electronic communication.” There are exceptions.&nbsp; Title I
            also prohibits the use of illegally obtained communications as evidence. [<A
              href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title18/pdf/USCODE-2011-title18-partI-chap119-sec2515.pdf">18
              U.S.C. § 2515</A>].</P>
          <P>Title II of the ECPA, which is called the Stored Communications Act (SCA),
            protects the privacy of the contents of files stored by service providers and of
            records held about the subscriber by service providers, such as subscriber name,
            billing records, or IP addresses.&nbsp; [<A

              U.S.C. §§ 2701-12</A>].</P>
          <P>Title III of the ECPA, which addresses pen register and trap and trace
            devices, requires government entities to obtain a court order authorizing the
            installation and use of a pen register (a device that captures the dialed
            numbers and related information to which outgoing calls or communications are
            made by the subject) and/or a trap and trace (a device that captures the numbers
            and related information from which incoming calls and communications coming to
            the subject have originated). No actual communications are intercepted by a pen
            register or trap and trace. [<A
