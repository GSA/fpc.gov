<H4><STRONG>Overview</STRONG></H4>

               
<P>

         On July 12, 1974, the National Research Act (Pub. L. 93-348) was signed into law, thereby creating the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research (the “Commission”). The current U.S. system of protection for human research subjects is heavily influenced by the Belmont Report, written in 1979 by the Commission.
<BR><BR>
In 1985, Congress enacted 42 U.S.C. § 289, providing that “The Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) shall by regulation require that each entity which applies for a grant, contract, or cooperative agreement under this chapter for any project or program which involves the conduct of biomedical or behavioral research involving human subjects submit in or with its application for such grant, contract, or cooperative agreement assurances satisfactory to the Secretary that it has established (in accordance with regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe) a board (to be known as an ‘Institutional Review Board’) to review biomedical and behavioral research involving human subjects conducted at or supported by such entity in order to protect the rights of the human subjects of such research.”
<BR><BR>
The Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects or the “Common Rule” was published in 1991 and codified in separate regulations by 15 Federal departments and agencies. The HHS regulations, 45 CFR part 46, include four subparts: subpart A, also known as the Federal Policy or the “Common Rule”; subpart B, additional protections for pregnant women, human fetuses, and neonates; subpart C, additional protections for prisoners; and subpart D, additional protections for children. A fifth subpart, subpart E, which concerns registration of Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) was added in 2009.  For all participating departments and agencies, the Common Rule outlines the basic provisions for IRBs, informed consent, and Assurances of Compliance. Human subject research conducted or supported by each Federal department/agency is governed by the regulations of that department/agency. The head of that department/agency retains final judgment as to whether a particular activity it conducts or supports is covered by the Common Rule. If an institution seeks guidance on implementation of the Common Rule and other applicable Federal regulations, the institution should contact the department/agency conducting or supporting the research.
<BR><BR>
The HHS and fifteen other Federal departments and agencies have issued final revisions to the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects (the Common Rule). The Final Rule was published in the Federal Register on January 19, 2017. It implements new steps to better protect human subjects involved in research, while facilitating valuable research and reducing burden, delay, and ambiguity for investigators.

  The following terms in the Common Rule outline the regulation’s applicability to privacy:
<BR><BR>
Section 102(f) of 45 CFR 46 defines “human subject” as “a living individual about whom an investigator (whether professional or student) conducting research obtains:
<BR><BR>
(1) Data through intervention or interaction with the individual, or<BR>
(2) Identifiable private information.”

<BR><BR>

<I>Private information</I> includes information about behavior that occurs in a context in which an individual can reasonably expect that no observation or recording is taking place, and information which has been provided for specific purposes by an individual and which the individual can reasonably expect will not be made public (for example, a medical record). Private information must be individually identifiable (i.e., the identity of the subject is or may readily be ascertained by the investigator or associated with the information) in order for obtaining the information to constitute research involving human subjects.

Each agency that has implemented the Common Rule includes in its chapter of the Code of Federal Regulations section numbers and language that are identical to those of the HHS codification at 45 CFR part 46, subpart A. For the complete list and chapters of the CFR see:
