<H4><STRONG>Overview</STRONG></H4>

        In response to concerns that emerging technologies such as digital and wireless communications were making it increasingly difficult for law enforcement agencies to execute authorized surveillance, Congress enacted CALEA on October 25, 1994. CALEA requires a “telecommunications carrier,” as defined by the CALEA statute, to ensure that equipment, facilities, or services that allow a customer or subscriber to “originate, terminate, or direct communications,” enable law enforcement officials to conduct electronic surveillance pursuant to court order or other lawful authorization. CALEA is intended to preserve the ability of law enforcement agencies to conduct electronic surveillance by requiring that telecommunications carriers and manufacturers of telecommunications equipment design and modify their equipment, facilities, and services to ensure that they have the necessary surveillance capabilities as communications network technologies evolve. CALEA is limited to Telecommunications Carriers as defined by the Act and interpreted by the FCC.  In addition, CALEA specifically exempts “Information Services”, which includes many Internet based communications service providers, electronic storage providers and electronic messaging services.
