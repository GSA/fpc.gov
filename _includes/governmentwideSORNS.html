                <b>Categories of individuals covered by the system</b>
                <br>
                Individuals and/or their survivors who file claims seeking benefits under the Federal Employees’ Compensation Act (FECA) by reason of injuries sustained while in the performance of duty. FECA applies to all civilian Federal employees, including various classes of persons who provide or have provided personal service to the Government of the United States, and to other persons as defined by law such as State or local law enforcement officers, and their survivors, who were injured or killed while assisting in the enforcement of Federal law. In addition, FECA covers employees of the Civil Air Patrol, Peace Corps Volunteers, Job Corps students, Volunteers in Service to America, members of the National Teacher Corps, certain student employees, members of the Reserve Officers Training Corps, certain former prisoners of war, and employees of particular commissions and other agencies.
                <br><br>
                <b>Purpose(s)</b>
                <br>
                The FECA establishes the system for processing and adjudicating claims that Federal employees and other covered individuals file with the Department’s Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs (OWCP) seeking monetary, medical and similar benefits for injuries or deaths sustained while in the performance of duty. The records maintained in this system are created as a result of and are necessary to this process. The records provide information and verification about the individual’s employment related injury and the resulting disabilities and/or impairments, if any, on which decisions awarding or denying benefits provided under the FECA must be based.

                <b>Categories of individuals covered by the system</b><br>
                SAM currently has two functional areas which cover individuals. In the Entity Management functional area, SAM covers individuals who are sole proprietors and register to do business with the Government as sole proprietors. For purposes of this system of records notice, individuals with records in the Entity Management functional area will be referred to as ‘‘entity’’ or ‘‘entities’’. In the exclusion portion of the Performance Information functional area, SAM covers individuals who are excluded or disqualified under certain circumstances, including but not limited to the following: A Federal agency’s action under the Common Rules on Non-procurement suspension and debarment, or otherwise declared ineligible from receiving certain Federal assistance and/or benefits; individuals debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or otherwise declared ineligible from participating in Federal procurement programs; individuals barred or suspended from acting as sureties for bid and performance bond activity in procurement programs; individuals barred from entering the United States; and individuals that may be subject to sanctions pursuant to 31 CFR Parts 500–599 and subparts thereunder.
                <br><br>
                <b>Purpose(s)</b><br>
                The System for Award Management (SAM) consolidates functions that were previously handled by the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) system, Excluded Parties List System (EPLS), and Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). SAM provides the capability to manage information about entities wishing to do business with the Federal Government, and maintain information about those entities to ensure that entities seeking to do business with the Federal Government have not been debarred, suspended, or otherwise excluded from doing business. SAM maintains this Governmentwide system of records to enable Federal agencies to determine who is registered to do business with the Federal Government, and to identify individuals who have been excluded from participating in Federal procurement and non-procurement (financial or non-financial assistance and benefits programs), throughout the Federal Government. In some instances a record may demonstrate that an exclusion applies only to the agency taking the action, and therefore does not have Governmentwide effect. The purpose of these exclusions is to protect the Government from non-responsible contractors and individuals, ensure proper management throughout the Federal government, and protect the integrity of Federal activities.

                The FAR Data Collection System contains records related to prime contractors who are performing on federal contract awards (“prime contractor”), subcontractors, their employees (“prime or subcontractor employees”) and employed by the Federal Government. An owner, agent, or employee of a prime or subcontractor may enter or certify information, as applicable.
                <br><br>
                <b>Purpose(s)</b><br>
                The system facilitates collection of data that prime contractors and their subcontractors are required to submit. 
                Each agency is responsible for the collection, use and review of data pertaining to its contracts to verify 
                contractor compliance with applicable requirements. The system includes an online portal that allows prime or 
                subcontractors to enter, review and as applicable, certify FAR-required reports. While logged in, a prime or 
                subcontractor is able to enter data and review reports. After a required report has been entered by the prime 
                contractor or a subcontractor on a contract, the prime contractor certifies that the report is correct and 
                submits it to the contracting officer. Contracting officers and other authorized officials in the awarding 
                agency use the data from the system to review submissions for compliance with contractual terms and conditions 
                for contracts for which they are responsible.

                The Official Personnel File (OPF), which may exist in various approved media, and other general personnel records files, is the official repository of the records, reports of personnel actions, and the documentation required in connection with these actions affected   during an employee’s Federal service. The personnel action reports and other documents, some of which are filed in the OPF, give legal force and effect to personnel transactions and establish employee rights and benefits under pertinent laws and regulations governing Federal employment.  These files and records are maintained by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and agencies in accordance with OPM regulations and instructions. They provide the basic source of factual data about a person’s Federal employment while in the service and after his or her separation. Records in this system have various uses by agency personnel offices, including screening qualifications of employees; determining status, eligibility, and employee’s rights and benefits under pertinent laws and regulations governing Federal employment; computing length of service; and other information needed to provide personnel services. These records may also be used to locate individuals for personnel research.

                The records are used in considering individuals who have applied for positions in the Federal service by making determinations of qualifications including medical qualifications, for positions applied for, and to rate and rank applicants applying for the same or similar positions. They are also used to refer candidates to Federal agencies for employment consideration, including appointment, transfer, reinstatement, reassignment, or promotion.

                        These exemptions are claimed because this system contains investigative material compiled solely for determining the appropriateness of a request for approval
                        of an objection to an eligible's qualification for employment in the Federal service. To the extent that the disclosure of such material would reveal

                        to September 27, 1975, under an implied promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, the application of exemption (k)(5) will be

                        relating to access to an amendment of records by the subject. This exemption is claimed because portions of this system relate to testing or

                        subject would compromise the confidentiality of these records and their usefulness for statistical research purposes.<br><br>
