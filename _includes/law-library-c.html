<H4><STRONG>Overview</STRONG></H4>


<P>

The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) is an amendment to the Public Health Services Act in which Congress revised the federal program for certification and oversight of clinical laboratory testing. Two subsequent amendments were made after 1988. The law continues to be cited as CLIA ’88 as named in legislation.

In general terms, the CLIA regulations establish quality standards for laboratory testing performed on specimens from humans, such as blood, body fluid and tissue, for the purpose of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of disease, or assessment of health.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) regulates all laboratory testing (except research) performed on humans in the U.S. through CLIA. In total, CLIA covers approximately 254,000 laboratory entities. The Division of Laboratory Services, within the Survey and Certification Group, under the Center for Clinical Standards and Quality (CCSQ) has the responsibility for implementing the CLIA Program.

             CLIA regulations allow laboratories to give a patient, or a person designated by the patient, his or her “personal representative,” access to the patient’s completed test reports on the patient’s or patient’s personal representative’s request. To align with this requirement, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy Rule also provides individuals (or their personal representatives) with the right to access test reports directly from laboratories subject to HIPAA (CLIA-certified or CLIA-exempt laboratories). While patients can also get access to their laboratory test reports from their doctors, they have the option to obtain their test reports directly from the laboratory while maintaining strong protections for patients’ privacy.

The rules are issued jointly by three agencies within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services: the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which is generally responsible for laboratory regulation under CLIA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which provides scientific and technical advice to CMS related to CLIA, and the Office for Civil Rights (OCR), which is responsible for enforcing the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
