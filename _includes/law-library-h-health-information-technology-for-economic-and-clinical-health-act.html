<P>

            The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act of 2009 provides the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) with the authority to establish programs to improve health care quality, safety, and efficiency through the promotion of health IT, including electronic health records and private and secure electronic health information exchange. The HITECH Act amends Sections 3004 and 3005 of the Public Health Service Act to describe the processes for evaluation, adoption, and implementation of endorsed standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria for health IT.  Sections 13400-13411 of HITECH describe HHS’s work to improve privacy and security provisions for electronic exchange and use of health information, and sections 4001-4201 of HITECH establish the Medicare and Medicaid Electronic Health Record (EHR) Incentive Programs to provide incentive payments for eligible professionals, hospitals, and critical access hospitals as they adopt, implement, upgrade, or demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology.

       HITECH was enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and was signed into law on February 17, 2009.
<BR><BR>
The HHS Office for Civil Rights implemented important privacy and security provisions of HITECH, which lays out new and specific obligations for covered entities in the event of a data breach that include notifications to individual data subjects and in some instances, to the media.  Please see the entry for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for more complete information regarding privacy and security provisions for electronic exchange and use of health information.
<BR><BR>
HITECH established a process for the evaluation, adoption, and implementation of endorsed standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria for health IT, and created an Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) within HHS to oversee this process, assisted by two advisory committees. The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) conducts pilot testing for new technical standards.  The resulting certification criteria regulations ensure all health IT presented for certification possess the relevant privacy and security capabilities.
<BR><BR>
HITECH also established the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs, which encourage health care organizations to adopt EHRs through a staged approach. Each stage contains core requirements in the final regulations that providers must meet, including privacy and security requirements.
