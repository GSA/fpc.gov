       Section 13402 of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act (the “Act”) requires HIPAA covered entities to provide notification to affected individuals and to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) following the discovery of a breach of unsecured protected health information. In some cases, the Act requires covered entities also to provide notification to the media of breaches. In the case of a breach of unsecured protected health information at or by a business associate of a covered entity, the Act requires the business associate to notify the covered entity of the breach. Finally, the Act requires the Secretary to post on an HHS Web site a list of covered entities that experience breaches of unsecured protected health information involving more than 500 individuals.
<BR><BR>
The HIPAA Breach Notification Rule, 45 C.F.R. §§ 164.400-414, requires HIPAA covered entities and their business associates to provide notification following a breach of unsecured protected health information. Similar breach notification provisions implemented and enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), apply to vendors of personal health records and their third party service providers, pursuant to section 13407 of HITECH and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA).

      The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services added a new subpart D to part 164 of title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) to implement the breach notification provisions of section 13402 of the HITECH Act.  In developing the interim final rule, the Department consulted closely with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which administers similar breach notification requirements on vendors of personal health records (PHRs) and their third party service providers under section 13407 of the HITECH Act. The interim final rule and FTC’s Health Breach Notification Rule (74 FR 42962, published August 25, 2009) made clear that entities operating as HIPAA covered entities and business associates are subject to HHS’, and not the FTC’s, breach notification rule. Second, to address those limited cases where an entity may be subject to both HHS’ and the FTC’s rules, such as a vendor that offers PHRs to customers of a HIPAA covered entity as a business associate and also offers PHRs directly to the public, both sets of regulations were harmonized by including the same or similar language, within the constraints of the statutory language.  The HHS rule was finalized in 2013.
