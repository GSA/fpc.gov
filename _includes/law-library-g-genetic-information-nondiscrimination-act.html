The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was signed into law on May 21, 2008.  GINA protects individuals against discrimination based on their genetic information in health coverage and in employment.  GINA is divided into two sections, or Titles.
<BR><BR>
Title I of GINA includes provisions that generally prohibit group health plans and health insurance issuers from discriminating based on genetic information. These provisions amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), administered by the Department of Labor; the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS); and the Internal Revenue Code (the Code), administered by the Department of Treasury (the Treasury) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Department of Labor has jurisdiction with respect to employment-based group health plans. HHS in conjunction with the States administers these provisions with respect to health insurance issuers. The Treasury and IRS administer these provisions with respect to employers. Title I of GINA also includes individual insurance market provisions under the PHS Act and privacy and confidentiality provisions under the Social Security Act, which are both within the jurisdiction of HHS.
<BR><BR>
With respect to privacy, statutory amendments were implemented under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“the HITECH Act”)</A> in January 2013 to modify the HIPAA Privacy Rule to strengthen the privacy protections for genetic information by implementing section 105 of Title I of GINA. Specifically, the HIPAA Privacy Rule prohibits health plans from using or disclosing genetic information for underwriting purposes. The modifications also clarify that genetic information is health information and prohibit the use and disclosure of genetic information by covered health plans for eligibility determinations, premium computations, applications of any pre-existing condition exclusions, and any other activities related to the creation, renewal, or replacement of a contract of health insurance or health benefits.
<BR><BR>
Title II of GINA prohibits the use of genetic information in making employment decisions in any aspect of employment, including hiring, firing, pay, job assignments, promotions, layoffs, training, fringe benefits, or any other term or condition of employment.  It is enforced by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).
